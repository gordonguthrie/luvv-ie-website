What Is LuvvieScript?
---------------------

LuvvieScript is Erlang that compiles to Javascript - it is a lightweight, actor-based DOM scripting language for use in web browsers.

What Are Actors?
----------------

The Actor model is a progamming technique where units of concurrency share no state and communicate by sending each other messages. These units of concurrency are properly called **processes** (and not threads).


Why Is It Called LuvvieScript?
------------------------------

Most speakers of English have American English as their first dialect. In Blighty the word **luvvie** is slang for actor - allegedly from their habit of not knowing anyone's name and referring to everyone as darling or luvvie. And if I come across another project called **somethingerl** I will scream, I swear it...

LuvvieScript is part of the <a href='http://beamcommunity.github.io/'>Beam Community</a> which (for the second year in a row) has been selected to be in the <a href='http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014'>Google Summer Of Code 2014</a>.

Google <a href='http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page#1._How_do_payments_work'>pay</a> students $5,500 to work on open source coding projects over the summer. It's cool.
